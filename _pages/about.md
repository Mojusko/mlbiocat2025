## About
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #1C5B62;">Machine learning and data-driven approaches play an increasingly important role in enzyme design and engineering. These tools have the potential to drastically accelerate the development of bespoke biocatalysts, but numerous challenges remain. This workshop aims to bring together computer scientists and experimentalists to discuss recent advances as well as outstanding challenges in this emerging interdisciplinary field.</p>

### Goals of the Workshop:
- <span style="color: #6FA64A;">Foster collaboration among scientists in machine learning and biocatalysis.</span>
- Share experiences and challenges from past projects.
- Discuss gaps in accuracy, throughput, directed information, and risk assessment.
- Develop a white paper documenting short-term challenges and actionable goals.

### Key Topics to Address:
- Generalist tools like AlphaFold and ProteinMPNN.
- Specialized computational tools (e.g., molecular dynamics, docking).
- Defining search spaces for sequence and structure-based exploration.
- High-throughput experimental methods (e.g., microfluidics, automation).
- Measurement errors and assay reproducibility.
- Effective communication between wet-lab and dry-lab teams.
