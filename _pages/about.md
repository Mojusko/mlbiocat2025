## About
The "WetLab meets DryLab" workshop focuses on integrating machine learning approaches with biocatalysis to advance the design of novel functional proteins. The event aims to address current challenges and establish collaborations among European scientists in this emerging interdisciplinary field.

### Goals of the Workshop:
- Foster collaboration among scientists in machine learning and biocatalysis.
- Share experiences and challenges from past projects.
- Discuss gaps in accuracy, throughput, directed information, and risk assessment.
- Develop a white paper documenting short-term challenges and actionable goals.

### Key Topics to Address:
- High-throughput methods (e.g., microfluidics, oligo pools).
- Measurement errors and assay reproducibility.
- Generalist tools like AlphaFold and ProteinMPNN.
- Specialized computational tools (e.g., molecular dynamics, docking).
- Effective communication between wet-lab and dry-lab teams.
- Defining search spaces for sequence and structure-based exploration.
