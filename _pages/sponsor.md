We are excited to host the NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Adaptive Experimental Design and
Active Learning in the Real World. This workshop will bring together researchers from
academia and industry to discuss major challenges, outline recent advances, and
highlight future directions pertaining to novel and existing real-world experimental
design and active learning problems. The organizing committee includes members from
Microsoft Research, University College London, Stanford University, ETH Zurich,
University of Washington, and Google DeepMind.

Sponsorship Tiers
-----------------

This year, we will have a single sponsorship tier ("Gold Tier").

**Gold tier: $2000**

* Opportunity to provide digital or physical swag to workshop participants.
* Acknowledgement and logo placement on the workshop website.
* Acknowledgement during the workshop's opening remarks.

How We Plan to Spend the Budget
-------------------------------

The budget will be used for travel and lodging expenses for workshop participants who
are in need, to allow them to attend the workshop in person. It will also be used to
fund the Best Student Paper Award. Any remaining workshop funds will be "rolled over" to
future RealML workshops.
